Reading and manipulating images adding different noices using using gaussian and random noice
1. Read color image and show different channel
2. Read bird image and convert it into binary image
3. Read eye image and crop it
4. Read bird and cloud images and add them
5. Read bird and cat images, then implement blendImg function
6. Read BM_lowCont image and plot the histogram and perform Equalization
7. Read bridge image and add salt & pepper noise
9. Add random and Gaussian noise
